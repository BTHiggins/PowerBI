General stats
	Highlight areas of super high and low traffic
	Comment on the general change after covid

Impact of LTNs
	Get the dates and locations of where LTNs are and try and show before and after

Get a view of my route to work and days where there is very high traffic counts

Somehow find a visual that will allow you to highlight specific traffic routes <-- python should have this

	Maybe work a in a prohet model for comparison

countpoints = dimension, joins on count_point_id



Data prep:
	In report description, state "could have done directly from website, but incase link changes hosting it on github.
	Remove dupe columns found in the dimension
	Work out which way is "toward" and "away" from central oxford
		Base this on 'direction_of_travel' and long, lat position from central oxford long lat position.
			for long, lat, e.g. if oxford is 0, 0, North East would be 1, 1, therefore 'N' would be away, 'S' would be toward.
